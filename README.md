## Folder Structure

The project directory should be organized as follows:

```
/path/to/your/project
├── venv/
├── videos/
│   ├── channel1/
│   │   ├── video1.mp4
│   │   ├── video2.mp4
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── channel2/
│   │   ├── video1.mp4
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ... (more channels if needed)
├── metadata/
│   ├── channel1.csv
│   ├── channel2.csv
│   └── ... (more CSV files for other channels)
├── client_secret.json
├── upload_log.txt
├── upload_videos.py
└── cron_log.txt
```

### Explanation

- **`venv/`**: Virtual environment directory containing installed Python packages.
- **`videos/`**: Directory for storing video files. Each channel has its own subdirectory.
- **`metadata/`**: Directory for storing metadata CSV files generated by the script.
- **`client_secret.json`**: OAuth 2.0 client secrets file from Google Cloud for API authentication.
- **`upload_log.txt`**: Log file for tracking uploaded videos.
- **`upload_videos.py`**: Main Python script for uploading videos.
- **`cron_log.txt`**: Log file for cron job output.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip
- Google Cloud project with YouTube Data API enabled
- OAuth 2.0 client credentials (`client_secret.json`)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/automated-youtube-uploader.git
cd automated-youtube-uploader
```

### 2. Create Project Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p videos metadata
mkdir -p videos/channel1 videos/channel2
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Required Python Libraries

```bash
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
```

### 5. Add OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials

Download `client_secret.json` from your Google Cloud project and place it in the project directory.

## Configuration

### Metadata Configuration

Define metadata for each channel in the `upload_videos.py` script:

```python
channels_metadata = {
    'channel1': {
        'title': 'Title for Channel 1',
        'description': 'Description for Channel 1',
        'tags': 'tag1,tag2,tag3'
    },
    'channel2': {
        'title': 'Title for Channel 2',
        'description': 'Description for Channel 2',
        'tags': 'tag4,tag5,tag6'
    },
    # Add metadata for more channels as needed
}
```

### Channel Upload Configuration

Define the number of uploads per day for each channel in the `main` function:

```python
channels = [
    {'name': 'channel1', 'uploads_per_day': 3},
    {'name': 'channel2', 'uploads_per_day': 1},
    # Add more channels as needed with their respective upload counts
]
```

## Running the Script

### 1. Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
source /path/to/your/project/venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Run the Script Manually

```bash
python upload_videos.py
```

### 3. Check the Output

Ensure CSV files are generated and videos are scheduled for upload. Uploaded videos are logged in `upload_log.txt`.

## Automating with Cron

### 1. Open Crontab for Editing

```bash
crontab -e
```

### 2. Add the Cron Job Entry

```bash
0 2 * * * source /path/to/your/project/venv/bin/activate && /path/to/your/project/venv/bin/python /path/to/your/project/upload_videos.py >> /path/to/your/project/cron_log.txt 2>&1
```

This sets the script to run daily at 2 AM.

### 3. Verify Cron Job

```bash
crontab -l
```

### 4. Monitor Cron Job Execution

```bash
cat /path/to/your/project/cron_log.txt
```

## Logging

- **`upload_log.txt`**: Contains a record of uploaded video filenames to prevent re-uploads.
- **`cron_log.txt`**: Contains the output of the cron job for monitoring and debugging.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure `client_secret.json` is correctly placed in the project directory.
- Verify internet connectivity for API authentication and video uploads.
- Check `cron_log.txt` for any errors or issues with the cron job execution.
- Ensure the virtual environment is activated before running the script manually.
